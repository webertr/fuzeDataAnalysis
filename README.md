## FuZE Data Analysis

# Introduction

This is a collection of source code in C and C++ that I have used on the FuZE experiment. I am begining to get more organized with this. Below identifies mark down language file links that will explain the source code of various components.


## Spectroscopy Monitor (spectroscopyMonitor.cpp)

This is a file that will supply functions to monitor the FuZE Control System, and upload spectroscoy data from Princeton Instruments software, Light Field, to an MDSplus data. Details of this analysis are found here:
